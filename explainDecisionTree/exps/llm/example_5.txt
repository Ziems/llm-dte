The decision tree determined the test mushroom to be poisonous based on a set of characteristics.

Firstly, it considered the smell of the mushroom (odor). Since the mushroom had a smell that didn't fall into category 'n', the path in the decision tree moved to the next step. 

Next, considering the root of the stalk (stalk-root), the data available for the test mushroom was inconclusive (?), but for the decision tree this condition resembles a case where the root of the stalk doesn't fall under category 'c'.

Aside from this, the texture of the stalk's surface below the ring (stalk-surface-below-ring) was 's', which again didn't fall under category 'y'. 

Lastly, the smell of the mushroom (odor) was revisited. Here, the decision tree identifies that the smell of the mushroom is not category 'a'.

So, based on these characteristics - the particular smell of the mushroom, its indeterminable stalk-root, the texture of the stalk's surface below the ring, and the absence of a specific odor - the decision tree classified the mushroom as poisonous. It should be noted that these classifications are derived from patterns in the trained dataset, and certain conditions are more or less likely to indicate a poisonous mushroom.
