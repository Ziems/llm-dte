The decision tree determined that the mushroom is poisonous based on its smell and the texture of the stalk surface below the ring, in addition to the unknown state of the stalk root.

The analysis began by considering the smell, or the 'odor' of the mushroom. Since the odor is described as 'y', which doesn't align with none (odor_n), the tree moved down the left branch to further evaluate the mushroom.

The decision tree next focused on the root of the stalk, or the 'stalk-root'. However, this detail was unknown in the tested mushroom, thus it again proceeded down the left side of the tree due to 'stalk-root_c' not being applicable.

The tree then examined the texture of the stalk surface below the mushroom's ring, known as 'stalk-surface-below-ring'. The given mushroom has this texture as 's', which is not 'y', making the pathway to take once again the left of the tree.

Lastly, the smell or 'odor' of the mushroom was again reconsidered. Since its odor is 'y' and not 'a' like in 'odor_a', it again took the left side of the tree where the tree concluded that the mushroom in question is poisonous.

Through these steps, the tree integrates multiple characteristics of the mushroom, like smell, stalk-root, and the texture below its ring, to establish that it's most likely harmful if consumed.
