The decision tree examined several attributes of the mushroom to identify if it's safe to eat or not. Firstly, it considered the smell of the mushroom (odor). In this case, the mushroom had an odor profile denoted as "y", which is different from "n" and "a"; therefore, it moved down the tree.

Next, it looked at the root of the stalk. Here, we don't have an exact attribute value, depicted as "?". The absence of the stalk-root "c" attribute value propelled the decision down the left of the tree.

Afterwards, the decision tree considered the texture of the stalk surface below the ring of the mushroom. Since the texture was "s" (smooth), which was different from "y", the decision process continued along the left side of the tree.

Finally, the decision tree once again looked at the odor of this mushroom. Since the odor was still "y", and not "a", the evaluation took the left-most route on the tree.

These observations led the decision tree to classify this mushroom as poisonous. In simple terms, the characteristics of the mushroom - specifically its distinct smell, lack of certain stalk-root characteristics, smooth surface below the ring on the stalk, and the fact the smell is not "almond" - suggested that this mushroom is more likely to be poisonous, rather than being safe to eat.
