The decision tree determined that the example is setosa because the petal width feature of the example, which is 0.4 cm, is less than or equal to 0.80 cm. Essentially, according to the decision tree's rules, if a flower has a petal width of 0.80 cm or less, it is categorized as a setosa type. So, because the petal width of this particular example (0.4 cm) falls into this category, the tree concluded that it was the setosa type.


If petal width (cm) had been significantly larger than 0.40, would the outcome have been the same?
False

If petal width (cm) had been significantly smaller than 0.40, would the outcome have been the same?
True
