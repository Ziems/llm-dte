Suppose a dataset for network intrusion detection has the following features:
class represents the class,
cap-shape represents the the shape of the mushroom cap (e.g., bell, conical, convex, flat, knobbed, sunken),
cap-surface represents the the texture of the mushroom cap surface (e.g., fibrous, grooves, scaly, smooth),
cap-color represents the the color of the mushroom cap (e.g., brown, pink, white, red, buff, purple, cinnamon, green),
bruises represents the presence of bruises on the mushroom (e.g., bruises or no bruises),
odor represents the the smell of the mushroom (e.g., almond, anise, creosote, fishy, foul, musty, none, pungent, spicy),
gill-attachment represents the how the gills are attached to the stem (e.g., attached, descending, free, notched),
gill-spacing represents the spacing between the gills (e.g., close, crowded, distant),
gill-size represents the the size of the gills (e.g., broad, narrow),
gill-color represents the the color of the gills (e.g., black, brown, buff, chocolate, gray, green, orange, pink, purple, red, white, yellow),
stalk-shape represents the the shape of the stalk (e.g., enlarging, tapering),
stalk-root represents the the root of the stalk (e.g., bulbous, club, cup, equal, rhizomorphs, rooted, missing),
stalk-surface-above-ring represents the the texture of the stalk surface above the ring (e.g., fibrous, scaly, silky, smooth),
stalk-surface-below-ring represents the the texture of the stalk surface below the ring (e.g., fibrous, scaly, silky, smooth),
stalk-color-above-ring represents the the color of the stalk above the ring (e.g., brown, buff, cinnamon, gray, orange, pink, red, white, yellow),
stalk-color-below-ring represents the the color of the stalk below the ring (e.g., brown, buff, cinnamon, gray, orange, pink, red, white, yellow),
veil-type represents the the type of veil (e.g., partial, universal),
veil-color represents the the color of the veil (e.g., brown, orange, white, yellow),
ring-number represents the the number of rings on the stalk (e.g., none, one, two),
ring-type represents the the type of ring (e.g., cobwebby, evanescent, flaring, large, none, pendant, sheathing, zone),
spore-print-color represents the the color of the mushroom spore print (e.g., black, brown, buff, chocolate, green, orange, purple, white, yellow),
population represents the the population distribution of the mushroom (e.g., abundant, clustered, numerous, scattered, several, solitary),
habitat represents the the habitat where the mushroom grows (e.g., grasses, leaves, meadows, paths, urban, waste, woods)

The labels are edible and poisonous.

A new test example has the following relevant features:
(odor = y
stalk-root = ?
stalk-surface-below-ring = s
odor = y
)

The new test example took the following path through the tree:
Step 1: Feature odor_n <= 0.50 -> LEFT
Step 2: Feature stalk-root_c <= 0.50 -> LEFT
Step 3: Feature stalk-surface-below-ring_y <= 0.50 -> LEFT
Step 4: Feature odor_a <= 0.50 -> LEFT



If odor had been different, would the outcome have been the same?
False

If odor had been different, would the outcome have been the same?
False

If stalk-root had been different, would the outcome have been the same?
False

If stalk-surface-below-ring had been different, would the outcome have been the same?
False

Was class considered?
False

Was veil-color considered?
False
