Suppose a dataset for network intrusion detection has the following features:
sepal length (cm),
sepal width (cm),
petal length (cm),
petal width (cm)

The labels are versicolor and setosa and virginica.

A new test example has the following relevant features:
(petal length (cm) = 1.5)

The new test example took the following path through the tree:
Step 1: Feature petal length (cm) <= 2.45 -> LEFT



If petal length (cm) had been significantly larger than 1.50, would the outcome have been the same?
False

If petal length (cm) had been significantly smaller than 1.50, would the outcome have been the same?
True
